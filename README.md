# RPG Project

This is a small-scale RPG game developed using **Unity** and **C#** as part of my journey to gain deeper understanding and hands-on experience with game development. The project includes fundamental RPG elements like movement, basic combat, and a simple user interface, brought together to create a fluid and playable experience.

## 🎯 Purpose

I built this project primarily to **improve my skills in Unity and C#** through practical implementation. I believe in learning by doing, and this project represents the knowledge I’ve gathered and the challenges I’ve overcome along the way.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Unity (Game Engine)
- C#
- Fuse (Character assets)

## 🔍 Key Features

- Functional player movement and control  
- **Custom melee weapon system**  
- Health and damage mechanics  
- Simple UI elements (Health bars, menus, etc.)  
- Smooth and responsive gameplay feel despite being a learning project

## 🧩 Challenges

Designing and implementing **weapon mechanics** was the most complex and rewarding part of this process. It pushed me to understand Unity's event-driven system, collision handling, and animation synchronization.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Scene organization and prefab management in Unity  
- Game loop logic and script optimization  
- Creating UI elements and linking them to game data  
- Navigating Fuse assets and integrating them into Unity

## 🙋 Why This Project Matters

This project may not have a storyline or cinematic polish, but it reflects the mindset of someone actively **learning**, exploring, and applying game development concepts. If you're looking for a teammate or junior developer who's passionate and not afraid to dive deep — I'm that guy.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Implement ranged combat mechanics  
- Add a simple inventory system  
- Polish animations and transitions for better visual feedback
